# vision
This is a simple vehile detection project using Computer Vision

Here I used background subtractions methods of OpenCV Library of Python and some morphological transformation for accuracy.
But this is for only static cameras. 

At the corner of the video you can see the count of the vehicles which gets recorded
when they cross a predefined limit. For the calculation of the object coordinates and object ids I defined a class called vehicles.py

For running it, just download all files and run the main.py
Thank you.


## Demo
A simple demo to show how the `VideoCapture()` works with the webcam:
> `python video_capture_demo.py`


## Set up
1. (Optional) It is highly recommended to set up and run this in a separate [conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/) environment.
2. Install required packages:
    > `python install -r requirements.txt`
3. You need to follow this step only if you want to try out the functionality that captures and processes video from a given URL of a traffic camera.
   - Install Chrome Web Browser (Other web browsers could also work. But corresponding changes are needed in the code.)
   - Find and download the matching [Chrome driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)
